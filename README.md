# 17Lands Visual Comparison Tool

I love 17Lands, but I have hard time CTRL-Fing through tables during a draft.

I built this so I could be a little more visual about the data.

## Development

Duplicate `.env.sample` and rename to `.env.local`.

`yarn dev`

## Testing

`yarn test` (unit)

`yarn cypress:open` (integration)
